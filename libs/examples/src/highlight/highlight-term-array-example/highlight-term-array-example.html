  Building experiences using Barista components means the accessibility
  knowledge of the designers and developers who built them are available to
  everyone and come for free with the usage of the components. Neverthesless it
  is still important to check a few things post implementation. Therefore we
  created the Barista Accessibility checklist which is based on the WCAG 2.1 AA
  standard. Barista's patterns and components are perceivable, operable, and
  understandable to users, even when using assistive technologies.
